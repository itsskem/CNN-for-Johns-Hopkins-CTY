mini project I did for Johns Hopkins CTY Program (Designing Inclusive Algorithims) summer course.

i used this preexisting model at first to see the simple structure of the model and followed their installation process (link below) https://github.com/Fatemeh-MA/Face-recognition-using-CNN/blob/master/CNN_Face_recognition.ipynb

edit i made ==> I used the latest version of tensorflow and keras pip install tensorflow==2.5.0 pip install keras==2.6.0

I used this for the code for the model https://towardsdatascience.com/loading-custom-image-dataset-for-deep-learning-models-part-1-d64fa7aaeca6
